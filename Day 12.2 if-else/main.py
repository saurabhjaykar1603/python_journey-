# Indentation

# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# conditional Statement 
# 1 if statement 

a = 20
b = 20
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
    
# 2 if else statement :

a = 10
b = 20
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
else :
    print("b is unequal to a")
    
a = 50
b = 30
if a > b:
  print("a is greater than b")
else:
 print("b is greater than a")

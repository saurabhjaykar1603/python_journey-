# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

# # range(start, stop, step) syntx
# for loop ar used to when you have a block of code which you want 
# to repeat a fixed number of time

for i in range(10):
    print("hello worls")

# Logocal Operators to use  Combine the Condtional statement

#AND operator
# result true : if both operation condtions are true otherwise False
# example

# HSC>60 and JEE>120 
HSC = 50
JEE = 140
result =HSC>60 and JEE>120 
print(result)

# output = False

HSC = 80
JEE = 140
result =HSC>60 and JEE>120 
print(result)

# output =True

# OR operatort
# result true if both operator condition are true & atleast one condition should be true
# neet>520 and jee>120 
neet = 80
jee = 130
result = neet>520 or jee>120
print(result)
# output =True

neet = 80
jee = 100
result = neet>520 or jee>120
print(result)
# output =False

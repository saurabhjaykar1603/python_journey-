# If else Ladder
# Python elif is used to execute a continuous chain of conditional logic ladder. In elif,
# there are multiple conditions and the corresponding statements as a ladder.

num = int(input("Enter number from 1 to 5 :"))
if num==1:
  print("You selected option 1")
elif num==2:
  print("You selected option 2")
elif num==3:
  print("You selected option 3")
elif num==4:
  print("You selected option 4")
elif num==5:
  print("You selected option 5")
else :
  print("You selected wrong input")

#   In the above example we create one num variable and in that variable we give input number from the user and checks whether the number is between 1 to 5. If the input is within the range, it displays the corresponding message, and if the input is out of range, it displays You selected wrong input.
